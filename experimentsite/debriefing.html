				<p>Thank you so much for your participation in this study. You have just completed a

series of task, all of which were intended to determine what is the influence of pedestrian crossing and pedestrian lights in your decision to cross
the street or not. <br>

The first questionnaire you filled out was about preconception of the autonomous cars. The

instrument tellsif you trust the autonomous car, how much you know about it and how you would react in front of it. <br>



If you have any questions about the investigation, or wish to know more, please feel

free to contact:

Emeline Ah-tchine ahtchine.e@gmail.com or 530-521- 0724

Dr. Erica de Vries erica.devries@upmf-grenoble.fr

Please do not discuss the study with any other students who might participate after

you. It is really important that they participate in the same way as you. That is, it is essential

they know nothing about the study before they participate.

Again, thank you so much for your participation. We hope you enjoyed participating

in this study as much as we enjoyed designing it.
		    </p>
